Themes allow you to change the look and feel of your Drupal site. You can use
themes contributed by others or create your own.

WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
--------------------------------

Put your downloaded and custom themes here. 
Placing downloaded and custom themes in this directory separates downloaded and
custom themes from Drupal core's modules that DIT put in a separate docroot directory. This allows for us to update Drupal core without overwriting these files.

DOWNLOAD ADDITIONAL THEMES
--------------------------

Contributed themes from the Drupal community may be downloaded at
https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme.
